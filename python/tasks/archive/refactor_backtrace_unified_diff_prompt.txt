You are refactoring a SuiteCRM PHP file.

Goals:
- Keep behavior identical (no functional changes).
- Improve readability/structure.
- Keep public interfaces stable.
- Do NOT change comments/docblocks unless strictly necessary.

Return ONLY a unified diff (git apply compatible) for exactly ONE file.
- The very first line MUST be: diff --git a/include/dir_inc.php b/include/dir_inc.php
- Include unified diff headers: --- a/include/dir_inc.php and +++ b/include/dir_inc.php
- Include at least one @@ hunk header.
- Minimal diff; no extra commentary.
- Do NOT wrap the diff in markdown fences like ``` or ```diff.
- Every line in each hunk must start with ' ', '+', or '-'. For blank context lines, use a single leading space.

Target function: getBacktraceString()
Required behavior:
- Must capture output of debug_print_backtrace() to a string and return it.
- Must clean up any output buffering it starts.

Prohibited changes:
- Do NOT change function name or signature.
- Do NOT change surrounding functions.
