You are refactoring code in SuiteCRM.

Goal: refactor for readability and maintainability ONLY.

Target:
- File: include/CleanCSV.php
- Function: escapeField($field)

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT change behavior.
- Do NOT add/remove class methods or functions.
- Do NOT change any code outside escapeField($field).
- Output MUST be a single git-apply compatible unified diff patch.
- No markdown fences. No explanations.

Unified diff formatting rules (MUST FOLLOW):
- Start with: diff --git a/<path> b/<path>
- Include --- a/<path> and +++ b/<path>
- Include valid @@ hunk headers
- Inside hunks, EVERY line must begin with exactly one of: space, +, -, or \\.
  (Even blank context lines must be a single leading space.)
- End the patch with a newline.

Make a minimal change set: simplify conditions and early-return structure, but keep the same output.
