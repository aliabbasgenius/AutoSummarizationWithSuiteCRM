task_id: refactor-function-with-summary

description: >
  Refactor the function CleanCSV::escapeField($cell) in SuiteCRM/include/CleanCSV.php.
  Keep behavior identical (no functional changes). Improve readability/structure.
  Preserve exact behavior: if $cell is not a string OR is an empty string, return $cell unchanged.
  Otherwise, if the first character is in startingChars, return escapeChar + $cell; else return $cell.

objectives:
  - Keep behavior identical (no functional changes)
  - Improve readability and structure
  - Keep public interfaces stable
  - Do not change comments/docblocks unless strictly necessary

# Use a summary artifact to demonstrate the "auto summarization" approach feeding into refactoring.
# The agent will include excerpts from these artifacts in its prompt.
artifacts:
  - suitecrm_agent/runs/cleancsv_summary.json
  - include/CleanCSV.php

# Keep module summaries optional for this demo.
# You can add SuiteCRM module names here later if you want broader context.
