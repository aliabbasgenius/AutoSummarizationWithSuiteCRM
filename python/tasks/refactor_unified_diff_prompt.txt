You are refactoring a SuiteCRM PHP file.

Goals:
- Keep behavior identical (no functional changes).
- Improve readability/structure.
- Keep public interfaces stable.
- Do NOT change comments/docblocks unless strictly necessary.

Return ONLY a unified diff (git apply compatible) for exactly ONE file.
- The very first line MUST be: diff --git a/include/CleanCSV.php b/include/CleanCSV.php
- Include unified diff headers: --- a/include/CleanCSV.php and +++ b/include/CleanCSV.php
- Include at least one @@ hunk header.
- Minimal diff; no extra commentary.
- Do NOT wrap the diff in markdown fences like ``` or ```diff.
- Every line in each hunk must start with ' ', '+', or '-'. For blank context lines, use a single leading space.

Target function: CleanCSV::escapeField($cell)
Required behavior:
- If $cell is not a string OR is an empty string, return $cell unchanged.
- Otherwise, if the first character is in startingChars, return escapeChar + $cell; else return $cell.

Prohibited changes:
- Do NOT add parameter or return type hints.
- Do NOT change visibility, function name, or signature.

Make only small, safe refactorings (e.g., extract $firstChar variable).
