You are refactoring existing SuiteCRM PHP code.

Goal: refactor ONLY the existing method `Email::email2Send($request)` in `SuiteCRM/modules/Emails/Email.php` to reduce duplication and improve readability, with NO behavior changes.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT add, rename, or remove any class methods or properties.
- Do NOT introduce any new `$this->someNewHelper()` calls.
- You MAY use local variables and local closures inside `email2Send()`.
- Do NOT change external interfaces, request keys, global variables, logging, or side effects.
- Keep all existing business logic and conditionals equivalent.

Output format (very important):
- Return ONLY a unified diff patch (git-style) that applies cleanly to `SuiteCRM/modules/Emails/Email.php`.
- The patch must only change lines within the `email2Send($request)` method.
- No prose, no markdown fences, no explanations.
